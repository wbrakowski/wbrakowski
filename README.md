**Hard choices, easy life. Easy choices, hard life.**

I build tools and extensions for **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central**, focusing on improving the daily workflow of AL developers.  
My work includes developer utilities, VS Code extensions, and practical apps used in real-world BC projects.

I'm passionate about clean solutions, productivity, and sharing useful tools with the Business Central community.
